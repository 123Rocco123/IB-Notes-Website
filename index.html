    <h1> Introduction and main page </h1>        
    
    <p class="p"> This is the main page where you will be able to go to different subjects with all of the notes that I have written over the few months / years.</p>
    
    <p1 class="p"> This webpage not only is helping you improve your coding skills, but it also helps you to keep your notes organized so that when you have to look over them for the IB tests as well as during college, you'll have them in your very own organized Dropbox / Google Drive.</p1>
        
    <p2 class="p">As of right now the site is currently under construction, and the following issues are persistant for specific pages on this website:</p2>
