# IB-Notes-Website
IB website designed to help students by sharing notes for Physics, Chemistry, and Math.

## Current Goals
The numbers represent what is currently being worked on, the further down the list, the less important that improvement is.

1) The ability of different users being able to upload their notes to the website
  - This would have to be in PDF format so that different people will be able to download the notes rather than re-copying them down.

2) Uploading answers to differentiation and integration questions on the SL book.
3) Writing Topic 2 notes for Chemistry
4) Adding a feature to have the website generate random math questions that I have gathered from past papers so that I will be able to practice them.
5) Adding Past Paper questions for practice
  - The past paper questions should also include worked examples so that if someone gets somethin wrong they'll be able to understand how to work out the probelm themselves once they read the answers.

## Completed Goals
1) Writing Topic 1 notes for Chemsitry
2) Writing Topic 2 notes for Physics
3) Coding new page for Math Notes
